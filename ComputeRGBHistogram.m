function F=ComputeRGBHistogram(img,Q)
% INPUT: img, an RGB image where pixels have RGB values in range 0-255
% INPUT: Q, the level of quantization of the RGB space e.g. 4
% First, create qimg, an image where RGB are normalised in range 0 to (Q-1)
% We do this by dividing each pixel value by 256 (to give range 0 - just
% under 1) and then multiply this by Q, then drop the decimal point.
qimg=double(img);
qimg=floor(qimg.*Q);
% Now, create a single integer value for each pixel that summarises the
% RGB value. We will use this as the bin index in the histogram.
bin = qimg(:,:,1)*Q^2 + qimg(:,:,2)*Q^1 + qimg(:,:,3);
% 'bin' is a 2D image where each 'pixel' contains an integer value in
% range 0 to Q^3-1 inclusive.
% We will now use Matlab's hist command to build a frequency histogram
% from these values. First, we have to reshape the 2D matrix into a long
% vector of values.
vals=reshape(bin,1,size(bin,1)*size(bin,2));
% Now we can use hist to create a histogram of Q^3 bins.
H = hist(vals,Q^3);
% It is convenient to normalise the histogram, so the area under it sum
% to 1.
H = H ./sum(H);
F=H;
